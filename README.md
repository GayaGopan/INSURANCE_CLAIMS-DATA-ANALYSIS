# NAIVE-BAYES-ALGORITHM
 Naive Bayes algorithm is to perform classification tasks based on probabilistic principles. The algorithm works by applying Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis  given the observed evidence. Despite its simplicity and strong assumptions, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice and can be trained quickly .
